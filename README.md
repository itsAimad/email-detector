# Email Detector with Streamlit and Machine Learning 

## Overview ðŸ”Ž

This project is a **email spam detector** built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning. It uses the Naive Bayes Algorithm to classify emails as spam or not spam(ham).

## Features 

- **Spam Detection** :  DEtects whether an email is spam based on its content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface using Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Model Training**: Includes scripts to train the model on
